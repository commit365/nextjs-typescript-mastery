# Lesson 19: Capstone Project

In this final lesson of the Next.js with TypeScript Mastery course, we will guide you through a capstone project that will consolidate your learning and showcase your skills. This project will involve planning and designing the architecture of a web application, implementing core features using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, integrating advanced Next.js concepts, optimizing performance, conducting a security audit, and deploying the application with monitoring and maintenance strategies. By the end of this lesson, you will have a complete project that demonstrates your proficiency in building modern web applications with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Project Planning and Architecture Design

### Defining the Project Scope

Before diving into implementation, it’s essential to define the scope of your project. Consider the following aspects:

1. **Target Audience**: Who will use your application? What are their needs and preferences?
2. **Core Features**: Identify the key features that your application will offer. For example, if you are building an e-commerce site, core features might include product listings, a shopping cart, user authentication, and payment processing.
3. **User Stories**: Write user stories to clarify what functionalities you need to implement. For example:
   - As a user, I want to view a list of products so that I can choose what to buy.
   - As a user, I want to add items to my cart so that I can purchase them later.

### Designing the Architecture

1. **Choosing a Tech Stack**: For this project, you will use Next.js with TypeScript for the front end, a headless CMS (like Contentful or Strapi) for content management, and a payment processor (like Stripe) for handling transactions.

2. **Creating a Component Hierarchy**: Plan the structure of your components. For example:
   - **Pages**: Home, Products, Cart, Checkout, Login, Signup
   - **Components**: Header, Footer, ProductCard, CartItem, Modal

3. **Database Design**: If your application requires a database, design the schema. For example, if using a headless CMS, define the content types and fields.

### Example Architecture Diagram

```
+---------------------+
|      Frontend       |
|   (Next.js + TS)    |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|    Headless CMS     |
| (Contentful/Strapi) |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
+---------------------+
|   Payment Gateway    |
|      (Stripe)       |
+---------------------+
```

## Implementing Core Features with TDD Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a software development approach where you write tests before implementing the actual functionality. This ensures that your code meets the required specifications and helps catch bugs early.

1. **Write Tests First**: Start by writing unit tests for your components and functions. Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing React components.

#### Example: Writing a Test for a Product Component
```typescript
// __tests__/ProductCard.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import ProductCard from '../components/ProductCard';

test('renders product title and price', () => {
  const product = { title: 'Test Product', price: 100 };

  render(<ProductCard product={product} />);
  
  expect(screen.getByText(/test product/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText(/\$100/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

2. **Implement the Feature**: After writing the test, implement the functionality to make the test pass.

#### Example: Implementing the ProductCard Component
```typescript
// components/ProductCard.tsx
import React from 'react';

const ProductCard: React.FC<{ product: { title: string; price: number } }> = ({ product }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{product.title}</h2>
      <p>${product.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductCard;
```

3. **Refactor and Repeat**: After the test passes, refactor your code if necessary and repeat the process for other features.

## Integrating Advanced Next.js Concepts

### Using API Routes

Utilize Next.js API routes to handle server-side operations, such as fetching data from a headless CMS or processing payments.

#### Example: Creating an API Route for Products
```typescript
// pages/api/products.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/products');
  const products = await response.json();
  
  res.status(200).json(products);
}
```

### Implementing Middleware

Use middleware for authentication and authorization checks, especially for protected routes like checkout or user accounts.

#### Example: Adding Middleware for Authentication
```typescript
// middleware/auth.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export function middleware(req) {
  const token = req.cookies.get('token');

  if (!token) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## Performance Optimization and Security Audit

### Performance Optimization

1. **Optimize Images and Fonts**: Use the Next.js `Image` component and the `next/font` module for automatic optimization.

2. **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports for large components to improve load times.

3. **Analyze Performance**: Use tools like Lighthouse to analyze your application’s performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Conducting a Security Audit

1. **Review Dependencies**: Use tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

2. **Implement Security Best Practices**: Ensure that your application follows best practices, such as using HTTPS, securing API routes, and validating user inputs.

## Deployment, Monitoring, and Maintenance Strategies

### Deployment

1. **Deploying to Vercel**: Use Vercel for easy deployment of your Next.js application. Connect your GitHub repository, and Vercel will automatically deploy your application on each push.

2. **Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables in your deployment platform to manage sensitive information securely.

### Monitoring

1. **Integrate Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like Sentry for error tracking and Google Analytics for user behavior tracking.

2. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical issues, such as performance degradation or error spikes.

### Maintenance Strategies

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep your dependencies and Next.js version up to date to benefit from the latest features and security patches.

2. **Backup and Recovery**: Implement a backup strategy for your database and important files to ensure data integrity.

3. **Performance Reviews**: Regularly review your application’s performance and make optimizations as needed.
